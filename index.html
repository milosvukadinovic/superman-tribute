          <li>His ship landed in the American countryside, where he was discovered and adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, a farming couple. They named him Clark. Clark displayed various superhuman abilities such as incredible strength and impervious skin, and his foster parents advised him to use his gifts for the benefit of humanity. Clark Kent resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. To protect his privacy, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Superman's love interest is his fellow journalist Lois Lane, and his classic archenemy is the genius inventor Lex Luthor. He is a friend of many other superheroes in the DC Universe, such as Batman and Wonder Woman.</li>
